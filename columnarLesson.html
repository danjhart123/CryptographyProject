            <p>Hello and welcome to our lesson for teaching the Columnar Transposition cipher.
                <br><br>
                During this lesson you will learn about the basics of how to perform
                encryption and decryption using this cipher by undertaking various
                tasks set out in this section!

            <p>
                Let us begin your fourth and last lesson on the world of cryptography by
                learning about the columnar transposition cipher. This cipher is
                the second transposition cipher we have come across so far so 
                if you skipped ahead and do not know what a transposition cipher
                is then go back to the lesson on rail-fence ciphers to learn.
                <br><br>
                So, how exactly does the columnar transposition cipher work? Firstly, as with all
                ciphers covered so far, we need a key to be able to encrypt a 
                word in this way. However, unlike all other ciphers we have seen
                before, this one can have 2 types of keys. The key for this cipher
                can either be a number or a word/string.
                <br><br>
                Move on to the next section to learn more.

        <div id="ctSectionTwo">
            <p>
                Once we have the key then we can perform the encryption of the plaintext.
                Let us look at the below example where we will take the plaintext of
                &quot;hello world&quot; and a key size of 4, meaning we have 4 columns
                for this round of encryption.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="C:\Users\Daniel\Pictures\columnar_transposition.jpg" alt="Vigenere cipher table">
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                So, as you can see from the above picture, to encrypt the plaintext 
                with 4 columns we take each letter of the plaintext and write it in
                a column of a table which is 4 columns wide. Once we reach the last 
                column, we move to the next row down and repeat this process until 
                all the letters in the plaintext have been written out.
                <br><br>
                Once we have our filled out table, we then concentrate on what order
                the columns should be written out in to create the ciphertext. If the 
                key is a number, then we simply write out each column in ascending order.
                <br><br>
                In this example, we have 4 columns, so the ciphertext would consist of
                the letters in column 1, followed by the letters in column 2,
                followed by the letters in column 3, and finally followed by the 
                letters in column 4. 
                <br><br>
                If we did this then we get the following ciphertext:
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <p id="columnarExample">
                <b> holewdlolr</b>
                <br><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Now if the key is a word then it is a bit different. The amount of 
                columns we would have would be equal to the number of letters in the
                keyword. Again, we will use the same example as above but using the 
                keyword of &quot;back&quot;. Now, instead of just writing out the 
                columns in ascending order, we write the keyword above our table, 
                with each letter in the key corresponding to a column.
                <br><br>
                So in the about example, column 1 would have the letter &quot;b&quot;
                above it, column 2 would have the letter &quot;a&quot;, column 3 would
                have the letter &quot;c&quot;, and finally column 4 would have the 
                letter &quot;k&quot;.
                <br><br>
                Now, when constructing the ciphertext, we write out the columns in 
                alphabetical order of the key. So in our example, we would do column
                2 (a), followed by column 1 (b), followed by column 3 (c), and finally 
                column 4 (k). 
                <br><br>
                This gives us the ciphertext:
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p id="columnarExample">
                <b>ewdhollolr</b>
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see, this is different to the ciphertext we get if we just
                had the number 4 as a key instead of a string. This demonstrates how
                different the output could be depending on the key used in the 
                encryption process.
                <br><br>
                To decrypt a message that has been encrypted this way you would need
                to know the key used. Once this is known you can recreate the grid 
                used by writing the ciphertext out backwards in the columns. As you 
                can see substitution ciphers seem to be harder to crack than transposition
                ciphers since transposition ciphers are simply just a reordering of 
                the original message.

                In this section we are going to put what you have learnt so far
                to the test. You will need to perform encryption tasks to help you
                become more competent with this form of encryption.
                <br><br>
                For this section you will need to pick out a word to encrypt 
                (plaintext), this word can be anything you want but it is best
                if it a long phrase/sentence. Got your plaintext? Great! Next we
                need a key (number or string) but in this tutorial you will be 
                given various number keys to use for encryption.
                <br><br>

                Use the below encryption tool to check your answers to ensure 
                you are getting them right. Got them all correct? Great job! Try 
                out some other keys and plaintext until you really get how to do
                this type of encryption.
