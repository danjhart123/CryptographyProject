            <p>
                Let us begin your third lesson on the world of cryptography by
                learning about the rail-fence cipher, also know as the &quot;zig
                zag&quot;. This cipher is the first transposition cipher we have 
                come across so far so maybe we should first cover what a 
                transposition cipher does.
                <br><br>
                In general, we have 2 main type of ciphers, substitution and 
                transposition. We have already seen substitution ciphers in the 
                for of the Caesar and vigen&egrave;re cipher. Both of these ciphers
                replace the letters in a word with completely different letters
                from a specific alphabet. Transposition ciphers are different due
                to the fact that they do not replace the letters in a word but 
                simply re-order the letters in a certain way depending on the 
                cipher used. Basically a transposition cipher &quot;jumbles&quot;
                up the order of the letters to create the ciphertext.
                <br><br>
                So that is how transposition ciphers work in general, but how 
                exactly does the rail-fence cipher work? Firstly, as with all
                ciphers covered so far, we need a key to be able to encrypt a 
                word in this way. The key for this cipher is a number which 
                represents the amount of &quot;rails&quot; that will be used in 
                this encryption.
                <br><br>
                The amount of rails is basically how many rows we have to work 
                with for encryption. To encrypt in this way, we take each letter
                of the plaintext and write it out diagonally, from left to right,
                with a letter in each row. We go downwards diagonally until we 
                reach the bottom rail, then we go up diagonally doing the same
                until we reach the top, then repeat the process. We carry out this
                process until we have no more letters left in the word to encrypt.
                <br><br>
                Once we have completed this process it is time to create the 
                ciphertext we require. To do this we simply write out the letters
                in the first rail, followed by the letters in the second rail, 
                and then do this for all of the rails until we have written out all of
                the letters. The new order of the letters is the ciphertext in
                this cipher.
                <br><br>
                To decrypt a message encrypted in this way we need to know how many rails
                were involved in the encryption. Once we know this, we divide the length
                of the ciphertext by the number of rails. We can then split the letters 
                in the ciphertext into groups that match the number of rails. So if we 
                had 3 rails we would divide the length of the ciphertext by 3 and then 
                start from the end of the ciphertext and write them out in a 
                reverse &quot;zig-zag&quot;.
                <br><br>
                Move on to the next section to see a worked example.

                In this section we will work through an actual example of the 
                rail-fence cipher to help cement your understanding of how it works.
                In this example we will use the plaintext &quot;this is a secret
                message&quot; and a key of 4 (4 rails will be used). Look at the 
                image below to visualise the example.
            </p>
            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="C:\Users\Daniel\Pictures\railfenceExample.png" alt="railfence example">
            </div>
            <p>
                As you can see from the above image we take the letters in the 
                plaintext and write them downwards diagonally from left to right.
                We do this until we hit the bottom rail and then start writing
                the letters out upwards diagonally from left to right until we 
                hit the top rail, where we go downwards again. 
                <br><br>
                We carry on doing this until all the letters have been used, at 
                which point we have our rails that we can use to create our 
                ciphertext.
                <br><br>
                The rails from this example are as followed:
                <br><br>
                <b>
                    Rail 1: {t, a, t, g}
                    <br><br>
                    Rail 2: {h, s, s, e, m, a, e}
                    <br><br>
                    Rail 3: {i, i, e, r, e, s}
                    <br><br>
                    Rail 4: {s, c, s}
                    
                </b>
                <br><br>
                To create our ciphertext we just write out the letters in each
                rail in ascending order (1 - 4). Once we do this we get the 
                ciphertext:
                <br><br>
                <b>
                    tatghssemaeiieresscs
                </b>
                <br><br>
                As you can see, this is a pretty affective way to hide a message
                as the new message is pretty unreadable. Move on to the next section
                to undertake some tasks yourself!

                In this section we are going to put what you have learnt so far
                to the test. You will need to perform encryption tasks to help you
                become more competent with this form of encryption.
                <br><br>
                For this section you will need to pick out a word to encrypt 
                (plaintext), this word can be anything you want but it is best
                if it a long phrase/sentence. Got your plaintext? Great! Next we
                need a key (amount of rails) but in this tutorial you will be 
                given various keys to use for encryption.
                <br><br>

                Use the below encryption tool to check your answers to ensure 
                you are getting them right. Got them all correct? Great job! Try 
                out some other keys and plaintext until you really get how to do
                this type of encryption. Move on to the next section to test 
                decryption.

                For this section you will be given multiple ciphertexts and key
                values that you will use to produce the plaintext and crack the
                code! Remember, to decrypt you need to divide the length of the 
                ciphertext by the key and write out the ciphertext backwards. To
                figure out which rail to start at, take the remainder and that is
                the starting rail (i.e remainer = 2, start writing backwards from
                rail 2.
