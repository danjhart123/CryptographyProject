        <h1> History of Cryptography </h2>
        <div id = "sideNavBar">

            <p id="historyText">Cryptography has been around for thousands of years 
                with the first recorded evidence of it being found in an inscription
                carved around 1900 BC, in the main chamber of the tomb of the 
                nobleman Khnumhotep II, in Egypt.
                <br><br>
                Move forward to around 100 BC to the reign of Julius Caesar and 
                encryption is still present. Caesar would send secret messages to 
                his armed forced using a form of encryption that is probably the 
                most historically known, a substitution cipher known as the Caesar cipher.
                <br><br>
                Even the 1st and 2nd world wars proved that encryption was still a prominent 
                technique of secret telling and message cracking with the development
                and use of Enigma machine and Morse code by the allied forces to 
                decrypt German encrypted messages and communicate over open radio 
                frequencies in secret.  
                <br><br>
                The Enigma machine was an electro-mechanical
                machine invented after world war 1 that was capable of encrypting 
                and decrypting messages which allowed up to 10^114 possible 
                configurations meaning that it was virtually unbreakable with brute 
                force methods. 
                <br><br>
                Fast forward to present day and cryptography has 
                evolved even more into a very technological science which is used in
                everyday life. Majority of data in todayâ€™s world like passwords or 
                financial information is saved or sent over computer networks in an 
                encrypted form to prevent 3rd parties from gaining access to private
                information. 
                <br><br>
                Even the messages you send on your phone on applications
                like WhatsApp provide you with security via cryptography with all 
                your messages on WhatsApp having end-to-end encryption. 
                WhatsApp end-to-end encryption ensures only you and the person 
                you're communicating with can read what's sent, and nobody in between,
                not even WhatsApp.</p>
