                Now it is time for lesson two on this site which is going to cover
                the topic of the vigen&egrave;re cipher. We will cover what it is
                and how it works.
                <br><br>
                A vigen&egrave;re cipher is basically a more advanced Caesar cipher
                because it uses more than one alphabet to swap out the letters,
                making it a &quot;poly-alphabetic&quot;, substitution cipher. In
                fact, the vigen&egrave;re cipher actually works in almost the same
                way as the Caesar cipher.
                <br><br>
                So how does it work? Like the Caesar cipher (and all other cryptographic 
                ciphers) we need a key to allow us to change the values in the 
                &quot;plaintext&quot;. However, unlike the Caesar cipher, the key
                for the vigin&egrave;re needs to be a word/phrase, not a numerical
                value.
                <br><br>
                So the Vigen&egrave;re cipher works using a string key and the Vigen&egrave;re
                table which is pictured below. 
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="C:\Users\Daniel\Pictures\vigenere.jpg" alt="Vigenere cipher table">
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>   
                As you can see, the Vigen&egrave;re table is a 2-dimensional table where 
                the rows and columns are both indexed by letters in the alphabet, 
                and the contents of the table are 26 different variations of the 
                English alphabet that has been shifted with the Caesar cipher by
                various shifting values. This table is used to encrypt a string using a string
                key word. So, how does it work?
                <br><br>
                Say we have a string we want to encrypt (the plaintext) and another 
                string that we will use to encrypt the plaintext (the encryption key)
                , we would match up the letters in the plaintext with the letters in
                the encryption key. Once this is done, we would look at the pairs of
                letters that have been produced by this step. 
                <br><br>
                We then take the letter from the plaintext and select the row with 
                that letter from the table. Next, we take the corresponding key letter
                and select the column with that letter from the table. The final step
                is to swap the letter from the plaintext to the letter at the point 
                where the row and column meet, we then repeat this process until all
                of the letters have been substituted. 
                <br><br>
                Basically, we replace the letter in the plaintext with the letter
                in the table that is at the index point [plaintext character, key
                character].
                <br><br>
                To decrypt a phrase that has been encrypted in this way we just 
                do the reverse. We take the key word and match it up with the 
                ciphertext that we want to decrypt, and like in the encryption 
                process, we then replace each letter in the ciphertext with the 
                letter in the table that is at index point [ciphertext character,
                key character].
                <br><br>
                Let's carry on to the next section to learn some more!

                Let us look at an actual example, we will have a plaintext of 
                &quot;cryptography web app&quot; and an encryption key of &quot;hello&quot;. In the first 
                step of this encryption we take the key &quot;hello&quot; and match it up 
                against the letters in &quot;cryptography web app&quot; as shown below.
                <br><br>
                *letter outside bracket = character from plaintext <br>
                *letter inside bracket = character from key
            </p> 
            <br>
            <p id="vExample">
                <b>c</b>(h)  <b>r</b>(e)  <b>y</b>(l)  <b>p</b>(l)  <b>t</b>(o)  <b>o</b>(h)
                <b>g</b>(e)  <b>r</b>(l)  <b>a</b>(l)  <b>p</b>(o)  <b>h</b>(h)  <b>y</b>(e)
                <b>w</b>(l)  <b>e</b>(l)  <b>b</b>(o)  <b>a</b>(h)  <b>p</b>(e)  <b>p</b>(l) 


            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Once this has been done, we will perform encryption based off the 
                pairs of letters and the Vigen&egrave;re table. Our first pair in this 
                encryption will be (c,h) where &quot;c&quot; is the first letter of 
                the plaintext and &quot;h&quot; is the first letter of the key. 
                We look at the Vigen&egrave;re table and select the row &quot;c&quot;
                and the column &quot;h&quot; and find the letter at the point where 
                these 2 meet (index [c,h]). In this case the new letter is &quot;j&quot;
                so we would replace the &quot;c&quot; from &quot;cryptography web app&quot;
                with a &quot;j&quot; so it becomes &quot;jomputer science&quot;. 
                <br><br>
                Let us continue the encryption below.

            <p>
                After this encryption the word &quot;cryptography web app&quot; becomes the 
                ciphertext &quot;jvjahvkcldoc hpp hta&quot; which is completely different. This 
                form of encryption is more secure than the simple Caesar cipher because
                without the key there is no way of knowing which variations of the 
                alphabet was used to encrypt the word.
                <br><br>
                if you are still unsure how it works then it may be easier to think about
                it in a simpler way. A simpler way to perform this encryption is to take (the character 
                value of the character in the key &minus; 1) as the shifting value and 
                simply shift the character of the plaintext by the shifting value. 
                This is done using the Caesar cipher. For example, if the key had the
                letter &quot;a&quot; we would have a shifting value of (1-1) = 0, meaning we 
                would not change the value. If it was &quot;b&quot; then the shifting value would be
                (2-1) = 1. We would then apply this to the rest of the alphabet so we 
                would know the shifting values to be applied in the encryption depending on the key.

                Now it it time to put what you have learn so far to the test by
                running through your own example!
                <br><br>
                Firstly, to perform this type of encryption, we need something to 
                encrypt. So, your first task is to come up with a phrase/word/sentence
                you would like to encrypt which will be your &quot;plaintext&quot;.
                It can be however long you want, the longer the better though!
                <br><br>
                So, you have chosen your plaintext? Great! For the next step, we 
                need a word/phrase to be used as the key, which will be given in
                the tasks below.
                <br><br>
                I am now going to give you various keys that you need to use
                to encrypt your plaintext. You need to produce the correct
                &quot;ciphertext&quot; for each of these key variations, which you
                can check after using the vigen&egrave;re cipher encryption tool at the 
                bottom of this section.
