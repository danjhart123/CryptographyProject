            <p>Hello and welcome to our lesson for teaching the Vigen&egrave;re cipher.
                <br><br>
                During this lesson you will learn about the basics of how to perform
                encryption and decryption using this cipher by undertaking various
                tasks set out in this section! 
                <br><br>

            <p>So, you want to learn how to use the Caesar cipher to encrypt
                and decrypt messages? Well you have come to the right place!
                <br><br>
                The Caesar cipher operates using an integer key value which we will 
                call the &quot;shifting&quot; value. We then use this value to change
                the character values in the message. We take each letter in the message
                and find its character value.
                <br><br>
                A character value of a letter corresponds to its position in the alphabet.
                In this lesson we will be working with the English alphabet (a-z). 
                So the values of our letter would be as followed;
                <br><br>
                The letter &quot;a&quot; would have a character value of 1, &quot;b&quot; 
                would have the value of 2, &quot;c&quot; would have the value of 3 and 
                so on until we get to &quot;z&quot; which has the value of 26.
                <br><br>
                Now, back to our cipher and how we use it to encrypt a message. 
                So we take the shifting value and add it to
                the character value of the letter in the message. This process changes
                the letters character code and therefor changes the letter to that of 
                the letter with the new character value.
                <br><br>
                For example, we have the letter &quot;m&quot;and a shifting value of 4,
                we take the character value of &quot;m&quot;, which is 13, and add 4 to it.
                This gives us a value of 17, the 17th letter in the alphabet is &quot;q&quot;, 
                so in our message we would replace every instance of &quot;m&quot; with
                &quot;q&quot;.
                <br><br>
                We carry out the same process for every letter in the message or 
                &quot;plaintext&quot;, to encrypt completely and obtain the secret message
                or &quot;ciphertext&quot; which cannot be interpreted without the key/ shifting value.
                <br><br>
                To decrypt the ciphertext we simply take the key and subtract it from
                every letters character value. So, say we had the letter &quot;o&quot;
                and a key of 10, we would replace &quot;o&quot; with the letter that is
                10 places earlier in the alphabet, which is &quot;e&quot;. 
                <br><br>
                Again, we carry out the same process for every letter in the ciphertext
                and will end up with the original message to read!
                <br><br>
                But what happens when the process of adding or subtracting the key from
                the character value gives a result that is out of range? I.e. the value
                is less than 1 or more than 26? Carry on to the next section to find out!

        <div id="cSectionTwo">
            <p>This section brings us to the key concept that allows this form 
                of encryption to become possible, modular arithmetic.
                <br><br>
                Modular arithmetic, also known as clock face arithmetic, is a system
                of arithmetic where the numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; when it reaches a certain
                value. Basically, if the number is bigger than a specific max value
                then we will divide the bigger number by the max value and take the
                remainder as the new value.
                <br><br>
                Let us do an example of how this would work in the case of the Caesar
                cipher. The maximum value a letter could have in the English alphabet
                is 26. So, when performing encryption using the Caesar cipher, we 
                would do the same as before, add the shifting value to the character
                value, but we add an extra step. After performing this addition we 
                would then divide the new character value by the maximum value, 26, 
                and would take the remainder as the new character value.
                <br><br>
                So, say we have the letter &quot;x&quot; and a shifting value of 11,
                the character value of &quot;x&quot; is 24, adding 11 to this would 
                give us 35, which it too large so it does not correspond to a letter.
                To get the correct letter we do modular arithmetic. We add the character
                value and the key together, so 24+11 to give us 35. Next, we take that 
                value of 34 and divide it by the max value (26). 
                <br><br>
                <b>34/26 = 1 with a remainder of 8</b>
                <br><br>
                So, we take the remainder value of 8 and this is our new letter, the
                8th letter of the alphabet, which is &quot;h&quot;. We would carry out this
                step for any values that go over 26 after the addition of the key takes
                place.
                <br><br>
                Go to the next section to work on some examples to cement your understanding!

                Now it it time to put what you have learn so far to the test by
                running through your own example!
                <br><br>
                Firstly, to perform this type of encryption, we need something to 
                encrypt. So, your first task is to come up with a phrase/word/sentence
                you would like to encrypt which will be your &quot;plaintext&quot;.
                It can be however long you want, the longer the better though!
                <br><br>
                So, you have chosen your plaintext? Great! For the next step, we 
                need a number to use as the shifting value. It can be any number
                but for this task we will use a number between 0-26.
                <br><br>
                I am now going to give you various numbers that you need to use
                to encrypt your plaintext. You need to produce the correct
                &quot;ciphertext&quot; for each of these number variations, which you
                can check after using the Caesar cipher encryption tool at the 
                bottom of this section.

                can try these tasks multiple times with different plaintext until
                you really get the hang of it!

                So, you think you are capable of communicating securely because
                you can encrypt a few phrases? But how will you read the messages
                sent back to you? That is what this section is all about, how to
                decrypt messages that have been encrypted with the Caesar cipher.
                <br><br>
                You have read about how to perform decryption in the earlier
                sections but now it is time to put your skills to the test!
                <br><br>
                You will be given multiple ciphertexts and their corresponding 
                shifting values/keys. It is your job to retrieve the plaintext
                from these ciphertexts by subtracting the key from each letters
                character value.
                <br><br>
                Use the decryption tool at the bottom of the page to check your
                answers, but only do it after you have attempted it otherwise 
                you will not learn how to do it properly!
