        <h1> Vigen&egrave;re Cipher </h1>

        <p id="vigenereText">

            The Vigen&egrave;re cipher is another substitution cipher like the Caesar 
            cipher but this one uses multiple alphabets for encryption, so it is
            known as poly-alphabetic. This cipher is not just similar to the Caesar
            cipher in the fact that it substitutes the letters in a word for a 
            different one, but the Vigen&egrave;re cipher actually works by using 26 
            different variations of the Caesar cipher.
            <br><br>
            Now one of the key differences between the 2 ciphers is that the 
            Vigen&egrave;re cipher uses a string as a key for encryption whereas the 
            Caesar cipher uses an integer &quot;shifting&quot; value as a key for encryption.
            So the Vigen&egrave;re cipher works using a string key and the Vigen&egrave;re
            table which is pictured below. 
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <p>   
            As you can see, the Vigen&egrave;re table is a 2-dimensional table where 
            the rows and columns are both indexed by letters in the alphabet, 
            and the contents of the table are 26 different variations of the 
            Caesar cipher, this table is used to encrypt a string using a string
            key word. So, how does it work?
            <br><br>
            Say we have a string we want to encrypt (the plaintext) and another 
            string that we will use to encrypt the plaintext (the encryption key)
            , we would match up the letters in the plaintext with the letters in
            the encryption key. Once this is done, we would look at the pairs of
            letters that have been produced by this step. 
            <br><br>
            We then take the letter from the plaintext and select the row with 
            that letter from the table. Next, we take the corresponding key letter
            and select the column with that letter from the table. The final step
            is to swap the letter from the plaintext to the letter at the point 
            where the row and column meet, we then repeat this process until all
            of the letters have been substituted.
            <br><br>
            Let us look at an actual example, we will have a plaintext of 
            &quot;computer science&quot; and an encryption key of &quot;hello&quot;. In the first 
            step of this encryption we take the key &quot;hello&quot; and match it up 
            against the letters in &quot;computer science&quot; as shown below.
            <br><br>
            *letter outside bracket = character from plaintext <br>
            *letter inside bracket = character from key
        </p> 
        <br><br>
        <p id="vExample">
            <b>c</b>(h)  <b>o</b>(e)  <b>m</b>(l)  <b>p</b>(l)  <b>u</b>(o)  <b>t</b>(h)
            <b>e</b>(e)  <b>r</b>(l)  <b>s</b>(l)  <b>c</b>(o)  <b>i</b>(h)  <b>e</b>(e)
            <b>n</b>(l)  <b>c</b>(l)  <b>e</b>(o) 


        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Once this has been done, we will perform encryption based off the 
            pairs of letters and the Vigen&egrave;re table. Our first pair in this 
            encryption will be (c,h) where &quot;c&quot; is the first letter of the plaintext
            and &quot;h&quot; is the first letter of the key. We look at the Vigen&egrave;re table
            and select the row &quot;c&quot; and the column &quot;h&quot; and find the letter at the
            point where these 2 meet (index [c,h]). In this case the new letter 
            is &quot;j&quot; so we would replace the &quot;c&quot; from &quot;computer science&quot; with a &quot;j&quot;
            so it becomes &quot;jomputer science&quot;. Let us continue the encryption below.
            <br><br>
        <p id="vExample">
            <b>
            c = index[c,h] = j
            <br><br>
            o = index[o,e] = s
            <br><br>
            m = index[m,l] = x
            <br><br>
            p = index[p,l] = a
            <br><br>
            u = index[u,o] = i
            <br><br>
            t = index[t,h] = a
            <br><br>
            e = index[e,e] = i
            <br><br>
            r = index[r,l] = c
            <br><br>
            s = index[s,l] = d
            <br><br>
            c = index[c,o] = q
            <br><br>
            i = index[i,h] = p
            <br><br>
            e = index[e,e] = i
            <br><br>
            n = index[n,l] = y
            <br><br>
            c = index[c,l] = n
            <br><br>
            e = index[e,o] = s
            </b>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
        After this encryption the word &quot;computer science&quot; becomes the 
        ciphertext &quot;jsxaiaic dqpiyns&quot; which is completely different. This 
        form of encryption is more secure than the simple Caesar cipher because
        without the key there is no way of knowing which variations of the 
        alphabet was used to encrypt the word.
        <br><br>
        To perform decryption of the message you need to know the key and 
        know how to use the Vigen&egrave;re table to look up the values. we do the 
        same matching up process with the ciphertext and the key like we did
        in the encryption process and then find the plaintext by looking at 
        the corresponding values at the index point [ciphertext character, key character].
        <br><br> 
        A simpler way to perform this encryption is to take (the character 
        value of the character in the key &minus; 1) as the shifting value and 
        simply shift the character of the plaintext by the shifting value. 
        This is done using the Caesar cipher. For example, if the key had the
        letter &quot;a&quot; we would have a shifting value of (1-1) = 0, meaning we 
        would not change the value. If it was &quot;b&quot; then the shifting value would be
        (2-1) = 1. We would then apply this to the rest of the alphabet so we 
        would know the shifting values to be applied in the encryption depending on the key.
