        <h1> Rail-fence Cipher </h1>

        <p id="railText">
            The rail-fence cipher (also known as the zig-zag cipher) is a 
            transposition encryption cipher which means that the ciphertext 
            contains the same letters that are in the plaintext but the order 
            of them has been changed. Basically, the letters in the original 
            string get jumbled up and reordered in a certain way. Like all 
            encryption ciphers we have seen so far this method needs a key to 
            encrypt messages. The key in this cipher is an integer value which 
            determines the number of &quot;rails&quot; to be used in the process.
            <br><br>
            Once we have the number of rails, we can perform the encryption. To do this we 
            take the letters in the plaintext and write them out in a &quot;zig-zag&quot; starting from
            the top line writing the first letter. Then we take the 2nd character and write 
            it on the next line down from and to the right of the first character. We carry 
            on doing this until we are on the line matching the maximum number of rails, once
            this point has been reached then take the next character and put it on the next 
            line up from and to the right of the last letter.
            <br><br>
            We carry on doing this until we reach the first line again and then repeat the 
            process going down until we have covered all the letters in the plain text. Once
            we have the plaintext written out in this &quot;zig-zag&quot; style on the rails we then 
            write the rails out in numerical order. We look at the first rail and write out 
            all the letters in that rail, then we look at the next rail and write out the 
            letters in that rail. Once we have written out all of the rails, we have our ciphertext.
            <br><br>
            Let us look at an example, we will encrypt the phrase &quot;hello world&quot; with 3 rails. 
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <div class="img-container">

        </div>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            As you can see from the image above, we write out each letter onto a rail
            going diagonally downwards until we reach the maximum rail (3rd rail) 
            which is the point where we will start to write out the letters going 
            diagonally upwards until we reach the top rail. We then continue this 
            process until we run out of letters to write out.
            <br><br> 
            So after completing this we have our rails:
            <br><br> 
        </p>
        <p id ="rails">
            <b>
                Rail 1 = {h, o, r}
                <br><br> 
                Rail 2 = {e, l, o, l}
                <br><br> 
                Rail 3 = {l, w, d}
            </b>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            To finish the encryption, we just need to combine all the rails together
            into a string. In this case we would do the letters in rail 1 followed 
            by the letters in rail 2 and finally followed by the letters in rail 3. 
            This gives us the ciphertext of &quot;Horel ollWd&quot;.
            <br><br> 
            To decrypt a message encrypted in this way we need to know how many rails
            were involved in the encryption. Once we know this, we divide the length
            of the ciphertext by the number of rails. We can then split the letters 
            in the ciphertext into groups that match the number of rails. So if we 
            had 3 rails we would divide the length of the ciphertext by 3 and then 
            start from the end of the ciphertext and write them out in a reverse &quot;zig-zag&quot;.
