        <h1> Caesar Cipher </h1>


        <p id="caesarText">
            The Caesar cipher is probably one of the first encryption ciphers 
            created and is definitely one of the simplest to use. It is a 
            mono-alphabetic substitution cipher which means that it only uses one alphabet for
            encryption and just changes the values in the alphabet to new ones. 
            This is less complicated than the Vigen&egrave;re cipher which 
            uses multiple alphabets which are based off of the Caesar cipher.
            <br><br>
            The Caesar cipher works by taking in a numerical value, usually an 
            integer, as a shifting value. This shifting value is then used to 
            change the letter values in the alphabet. Say we take the English 
            alphabet which has the characters a-z, each letter in that alphabet 
            has a corresponding numerical value, a has a value of 1, b has a value
            of 2, all the way to z which has a value of 26. During a Caesar cipher
            encryption we would take the numerical value of each character in the
            string that needs to be encrypted and add the shifting value onto the
            characters value. This will change the letter to another letter in 
            the alphabet.
            <br><br>
            For example, say we have a shifting value of 4, we would go through 
            each letter in the word and change the character code value by adding
            4 to it. The letter a would become f (1+4), b would become g (2+4), 
            c would become g (3+4) and so on. But what happens when the character
            value added with the shifting value would be bigger than 26? That 
            brings us to the key concept that allows this form of encryption to 
            become possible, modular arithmetic.
            <br><br>
            Modular arithmetic, also known as clock face arithmetic, is a system
            of arithmetic where the numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; when it reaches a certain
            value. Basically, if the number is bigger than a specific max value
            then we will divide the bigger number by the max value and take the
            remainder as the new value.
            <br><br>
            Let us do an example of how this would work in the case of the Caesar
            cipher. The maximum value a letter could have in the English alphabet
            is 26. So, when performing encryption using the Caesar cipher, we 
            would do the same as before, add the shifting value to the character
            value, but we add an extra step. After performing this addition we 
            would then divide the new character value by the maximum value, 26, 
            and would take the remainder as the new character value.
            <br><br>
            Still not sure how this works? Then let us do a real world example. 
            Say we want to encrypt the word &quot;hello world&quot; using a shifting value
            of 10. The letter h has a character value of 8, so we would add 10 
            to this giving us 18 as the new character value, turning the letter 
            from a &quot;h&quot; to an &quot;r&quot;. We do the same for the rest of the letters. 
            <br><br>
        <p id="caesarExample">
            <b>
                h = 8 + 10 = 18 = r
                <br><br>
                e = 5 + 10 = 15 = o
                <br><br>
                l = 12 + 10 = 22 = v
                <br><br>
                l = 12 + 10 = 22 = v
                <br><br>
                o = 15 + 10 = 25 = y
                <br><br>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now all these letters were still less than 26 even after they 
            changed value so we did not have to do the extra step of &quot;modding&quot; 
            the value. The next part of the letter will show how this works when
            it is needed.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p id="caesarExample">
            <b>
                w = 23 + 10 = 33 mod 26 (because 33 is more than 26) = 33/26 = 1 
                remainder 7 (so new value is 7) = g
                <br><br>
                o = 15 + 10 = 25 = y
                <br><br>
                r = 18 + 10 = 28 mod 26 = 28/26 = 1 remainder 2 = b
                <br><br>
                l = 12 + 10 = 22 = v
                <br><br>
                d = 4 + 10 = 14 = n
                <br><br>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            So, after encryption, &quot;hello world&quot; turns into &quot;rovvy gybvn&quot;. 
            As you can see this is very different from the word we started off 
            with so shows how effective and simple the Caesar cipher is to use to hide the 
            real content of messages.
            <br><br> 
            If you need to decrypt the message sent via Caesar cipher encryption
            you would need to know the shifting value that was used, which will 
            be known if you were the intended recipient of the message. To decrypt
            the real message you just do the opposite of the encryption, you take
            away the shifting value from the letters character value. 
            <br><br>
            If you are still not sure how this works, use the interactive Caesar
            cipher wheel below to help you out! The Caesar cipher wheel is a tool
            used to perform Caesar cipher encryption which uses 2 wheels of the 
            alphabet on top of each other. You would turn the outer wheel however
            many segments to the right that the shifting value is. This shift of
            the dial would tell you what each letter in the alphabet would 
            correspond too given a certain shift value. Hopefully this will help
            solidify your understanding!
