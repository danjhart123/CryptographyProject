        <h1> Columnar Transposition Cipher </h1>

        <p>
            The columnar transposition cipher is a transposition encryption cipher
            which means that the ciphertext contains the same letters that are 
            in the plaintext but the order of them has been changed. Basically, 
            the letters in the original string get jumbled up and reordered in a
            certain way. Like all encryption ciphers we have seen so far this 
            method needs a key to encrypt messages. 
            <br><br>
            Unlike the other encryption ciphers we have seen so far, the key in 
            this cipher can be an integer value or a string keyword which we use 
            to determine how many columns we will need and the order of the columns
            to be used in the process.
            <br><br>
            Once we have the key then we can perform the encryption of the plaintext.
            Let us look at the below example where we will take the plaintext of
            &quot;hello world&quot; and a key size of 4, meaning we have 4 columns
            for this round of encryption.
            <br><br>

        <br><br>
        <p>
            So, as you can see from the above picture, to encrypt the plaintext 
            with 4 columns we take each letter of the plaintext and write it in
            a column of a table which is 4 columns wide. Once we reach the last 
            column, we move to the next row down and repeat this process until 
            all the letters in the plaintext have been written out.
            <br><br>
            Once we have our filled out table, we then concentrate on what order
            the columns should be written out in to create the ciphertext. If the 
            key is a number, then we simply write out each column in ascending order.
            <br><br>
            In this example, we have 4 columns, so the ciphertext would consist of
            the letters in column 1, followed by the letters in column 2,
            followed by the letters in column 3, and finally followed by the 
            letters in column 4. 
            <br><br>
            If we did this then we get the following ciphertext:
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p id="columnarExample">
            <b> holewdlolr</b>
            <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Now if the key is a word then it is a bit different. The amount of 
            columns we would have would be equal to the number of letters in the
            keyword. Again, we will use the same example as above but using the 
            keyword of &quot;back&quot;. Now, instead of just writing out the 
            columns in ascending order, we write the keyword above our table, 
            with each letter in the key corresponding to a column.
            <br><br>
            So in the about example, column 1 would have the letter &quot;b&quot;
            above it, column 2 would have the letter &quot;a&quot;, column 3 would
            have the letter &quot;c&quot;, and finally column 4 would have the 
            letter &quot;k&quot;.
            <br><br>
            Now, when constructing the ciphertext, we write out the columns in 
            alphabetical order of the key. So in our example, we would do column
            2 (a), followed by column 1 (b), followed by column 3 (c), and finally 
            column 4 (k). 
            <br><br>
            This gives us the ciphertext:
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p id="columnarExample">
            <b>ewdhollolr</b>
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, this is different to the ciphertext we get if we just
            had the number 4 as a key instead of a string. This demonstrates how
            different the output could be depending on the key used in the 
            encryption process.
            <br><br>
            To decrypt a message that has been encrypted this way you would need
            to know the key used. Once this is known you can recreate the grid 
            used by writing the ciphertext out backwards in the columns. As you 
            can see substitution ciphers seem to be harder to crack than transposition
            ciphers since transposition ciphers are simply just a reordering of 
            the original message.
